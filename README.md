# üö® Fall Detection and Prevention System using ESP8266 and ADXL345

This project is a **low-cost, portable, and real-time fall detection system** developed using the **ESP8266 NodeMCU** microcontroller and **ADXL345 3-axis accelerometer**. It is designed to detect sudden falls and postural instability events and send **instant alerts** to caregivers via a **mobile application** using the **Blynk IoT platform**.

## üéØ Objective

To create an effective, wearable fall detection system that:
- Detects free falls and unstable postures
- Alerts caregivers via push notifications
- Supports remote health monitoring for elderly or industrial workers
- Operates on low power with long battery life

## üì± Mobile App Integration (Blynk)

- Real-time alerts sent to caregiver's smartphone
- **Virtual Pins**:
  - `V0`, `V1`, `V2`: X, Y, Z acceleration data
  - `V3`: Device status (active/idle)
- **Push Notifications**:
  - `"Free Fall Detected!"` (on fall)
  - `"Loss of Balance Detected!"` (on tilt > 45¬∞)

### üì≤ Example Notification:
> üîî *Free Fall Detected! Please check on the user immediately.*
